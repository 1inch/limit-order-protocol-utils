| ---------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `info`           | `String` | information about a limit order RFQ, encoded as a decimal number. Reade more bellow |
| `makerAsset`     | `String` | the address of the asset you want to sell (address of a token contract)             |
| `takerAsset`     | `String` | the address of the asset you want to buy (address of a token contract)              |

-   the timestamp of its expiration

Example of generating a limit order RFQ info:

```javascript
const id = 1;
const expiresInTimestamp = 1623166102;
const info = ((BigInt(expiresInTimestamp) << BigInt(64)) | BigInt(id)).toString(
    10
);
```
